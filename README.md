Hi friends, I'd like to introduce you to a small project I've made.

The Humanmade mark, here, is something I will be attaching to any works of mine that were mostly made by me or my friends, not by generative tools like GPT. I've built this website to freely share the high-resolution black or white versions of the logo available with you, which you can download and attach to your own projects if you'd like to make the same statement.
I've made the following video to try to make my reasons for making this clear, but it's simple:

I don't hate AIs,
I love humans!
